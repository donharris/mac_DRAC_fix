To enable old Dell DRAC cards to work with newer versions of Java on a Mac (mine is running Mojave)
  you need to disable (or rather 'enable') an unsecure format in java.

So, run 'locate java.security' and you'll likely have a couple of them.
Currently this is what minue looks like:
/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/lib/security/java.security
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/conf/security/java.security
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/jmods/java.security.jgss.jmod
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/jmods/java.security.sasl.jmod
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/legal/java.security.jgss
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/legal/java.security.jgss/COPYRIGHT

the one that I edited, which worked for me was the first one, for "Internet Plug-Ins".
I changed the second one, thinking that's the file that java was using, but it didn't work. Unless you need to change both
  which is how my laptop is configured now, so, it won't hurt.

Change this line to remove RC4:
(this is how it will likely read on your system)
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, DH keySize < 1024, \
    EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL
    
(this is how it should read after your change)
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, DES, MD5withRSA, DH keySize < 1024, \
    EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL
  
Save your file and you should be able to access your Dell DRAC cards.

If you can't, you need to edit the security listings:
1. open System Preferences
2. select Java (which will open the java control panel)
3. select Security (from the top menu)
4. select "Edit Site List..."
5. Add your DRAC card hostname/IP address - i.e. https://db01-drac
6. click OK

then you should be good to go!
